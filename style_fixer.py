Style Fixer Script

This script demonstrates how to automatically fix code style and formatting issues using Python tools.
It addresses:
- Inconsistent indentation (mix of tabs/spaces)
- Lines that exceed the recommended length
- Overall code formatting for improved readability

Usage:
    python style_fixer.py <path_to_python_file>
