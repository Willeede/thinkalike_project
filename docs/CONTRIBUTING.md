## Getting Started

Before you start contributing, please follow these steps:

1.  **Read the Onboarding Guide and Quickstart Guide.** These documents provide an overview of the project, its goals, and how to set up your development environment.  *These are now correct relative links.*
2.  **Explore the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Willeede/thinkalike_project).** Familiarize yourself with the project structure, codebase, and existing documentation.
3.  **Check the [Issues Tab](https://github.com/Willeede/thinkalike_project/issues).** Look for open issues labeled "good first issue" or "help wanted." These are good starting points for new contributors.
4.  **Join our community:** Introduce yourself on our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/TnAcWezH), and let us know what areas you are interested in.

## Contribution Workflow

ThinkAlike follows a standard Git-based workflow:

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Create your own fork of the ThinkAlike repository on GitHub. This gives you a personal copy of the codebase to work on.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/thinkalike_project.git  # Replace with YOUR fork's URL
    cd thinkalike_project
    ```

3.  **Create a Feature Branch:** For *each* contribution (bug fix, new feature, documentation update, etc.), create a *new* branch from the `main` branch. Use a descriptive branch name that reflects the purpose of your contribution. Use the following prefixes:

    *   `fix/`: For bug fixes.
    *   `feature/`: For new features.
    *   `docs/`: For documentation updates.
    *   `ui-test/`: For UI testing related changes.
    *   `style/`: For code style changes.

    Use this format: `[branch-type]/#[issue-number]-[short-description]`

    Examples:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b fix/#123-navigation-link
    git checkout -b feature/#45-add-login-form
    git checkout -b docs/#99-update-readme
    ```

4.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your contribution, following the coding style guidelines (see below) and best practices. Write clear, concise, and well-documented code.

5.  **Test Thoroughly:** *Before* submitting your changes, test them *thoroughly*. This includes:
    *   **Unit Tests:** If you're adding or modifying code, write unit tests to verify its functionality.
    *   **Integration Tests:** If your changes affect multiple components, test the interactions between them.
    *   **UI Tests:** Use the UI testing framework to validate the appearance and behavior of UI components.  *Emphasize the use of UI elements for testing and validation, consistent with the project's philosophy.*
    *   **Manual Testing:** Manually test your changes in a browser to ensure they work as expected.
    *   **Use UI testing parameters:** Use UI data feedback components to test and document your changes.

6.  **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with clear and descriptive commit messages. Follow the Conventional Commits specification (see below).

7.  **Push to Your Fork:** Push your branch to your *forked* repository on GitHub:

    ```bash
    git push origin your-branch-name
    ```

8.  **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
    *   Go to the main ThinkAlike repository on GitHub.
    *   You should see a prompt to create a pull request from your recently pushed branch.
    *   Click "Compare & pull request."
    *   Provide a *clear and detailed description* of your changes. Explain the *purpose* of the contribution, the *problem* it solves, and *how* you tested it. Reference any relevant issues (e.g., "Fixes #123").
    *   If your change affects the UI, include screenshots or GIFs demonstrating the changes.
    *   Select appropriate reviewers (if you know who to ask; otherwise, leave it blank).

9.  **Code Review and Collaboration:** Project maintainers and community members will review your PR. They may provide feedback, request changes, or ask questions. Be responsive and collaborative during the review process. Address any feedback and make the necessary revisions.

10. **Merge:** Once your PR is approved, a project maintainer will merge it into the `main` branch. Congratulations! Your contribution is now part of ThinkAlike.

## Code Style Guidelines

We strive for clean, readable, and maintainable code.  Please follow the guidelines in the [`code_style.md`](code_style.md) file.  Here are some general principles:

*   **Frontend (React):**  Follow the Airbnb React/JSX Style Guide, use functional components and Hooks, keep components small, and use CSS Modules or Styled Components.
*   **Backend (Python/FastAPI):**  Follow PEP 8, use type hints, keep functions short, and include docstrings.
*   **General:**  Write clear comments, use consistent indentation, avoid code duplication, and prioritize readability.

## Documentation Guidelines

*   **Markdown:** Use Markdown for all documentation files.
*   **Clarity and Conciseness:** Write clear, concise, and easy-to-understand documentation.
*   **Accuracy:** Ensure that all documentation is accurate and up-to-date.
*   **Completeness:** Provide comprehensive documentation for all aspects of the project.
*   **Structure:** Use headings, lists, and other formatting elements to organize the documentation logically.
*   **Examples:** Include code examples and usage instructions where appropriate.
*   **UI Driven:** Use UI components to provide feedback about data workflows, and to validate the correct implementation of those workflows.

## Commit Message Guidelines

## Using AI Coding Assistants

We encourage using AI coding assistants like Copilot or Gemini to improve your coding experience.  However, always *review*, *understand*, and *test* the code suggested by these tools. AI-generated code is not always perfect and may require modifications.  **You are responsible for the quality and correctness of the code you submit, regardless of whether it was written by you or by an AI assistant.**

Here are a few example prompts you can use:

*   **To understand a component:**

    > "Explain the purpose and functionality of the following React component, including the meaning of each prop and the expected data types:
    >  ```jsx
    >  [Paste component code here]
    >  ```"

*   **To write a test:**

    > "Write a unit test for the following Python function using pytest:
    >  ```python
    >  [Paste function code here]
    >  ```"

*   **To refactor code:**

    > "Refactor the following JavaScript code to improve readability and maintainability. Explain the changes you made:
    >  ```javascript
    >  [Paste code snippet here]
    >  ```"

*   **To write documentation:**

    > "Write a concise documentation comment (in JSDoc format) for the following React component:
    >  ```jsx
    >  [Paste component code here]
    >  ```"

*   **Debugging:**

    > "Explain this error: [Error message]. Here's the code: [Paste code]"
* **To write a commit message:**

    > "Write a conventional commit message for this change: [Describe the change you made]"

By providing *specific* code snippets and clear instructions, you can get much more useful results from AI assistants. Remember to always review and adapt the suggestions to fit the project's specific needs.
