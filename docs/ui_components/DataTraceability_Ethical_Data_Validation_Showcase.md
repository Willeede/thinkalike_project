## 4.2 Usage Examples - See DataTraceability in Action!

To illustrate the versatility and power of the DataTraceability component, we present a few concise code examples showcasing its integration into your React application. Each example highlights different facets of the component and demonstrates its ease of use and adaptability.

### 4.2.1 Basic Integration - Plug-and-Play Transparency

This example demonstrates the most straightforward way to integrate the DataTraceability component into your React application. With minimal configuration, you can immediately unlock powerful data flow visualization and ethical validation insights!

**Code Example (App.jsx):**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import DataTraceability from './DataTraceability'; // Import DataTraceability component

function App() {
  // Define example dataFlow prop for DataTraceability component
  const dataFlow = {
    overallEthicalScore: 78, // Example Ethical Data Score - represents overall ethical rating of the data flow
    overallValidationStatus: 'valid', // Example Validation Status - indicates overall validation status ('valid', 'warning', 'error')
    steps: [ // Array of data flow steps
      {
        title: "User Input", // Title of the data flow step
        description: "Data entered by the user through a form.", // Description of the step
        dataSource: "UserForm", // Source of the data in this step
        validationStatus: 'valid', // Validation status of this step
        ethicalStepScore: 92, // Ethical score for this step
        ethicalCheckpoints: [ // Array of ethical checkpoints for this step
          { guideline: "User Data Minimization", status: "valid", details: "Only essential user data is collected." }, // Ethical guideline and its validation status/details
          { guideline: "User Consent", status: "valid", details: "Explicit user consent is obtained." }
        ]
      },
      {
        title: "API Request",
        description: "Data sent to the backend API for processing.",
        dataSource: "Frontend App",
        validationStatus: 'valid',
        ethicalStepScore: 85,
        ethicalCheckpoints: [
          { guideline: "Data Encryption", status: "valid", details: "Data is encrypted in transit using HTTPS." },
          { guideline: "Secure Transmission", status: "valid", details: "API requests are sent over secure channels." }
        ]
      },
    ],
  };

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Integrate DataTraceability component, passing dataFlow and title props */}
      <DataTraceability dataFlow={dataFlow} title="Basic Data Flow Example" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;

(Observe how the DataTraceability component, with minimal code, immediately provides a clear and visually compelling representation of your data flow and its ethical validation status!)

Key Takeaways from this Example:

Effortless Integration: Simply import the DataTraceability component and pass in your dataFlow prop – and you're done!

Immediate Value: Even with basic data, the component instantly provides valuable insights into data flow and ethical considerations.

Foundation for Expansion: This basic integration serves as a solid foundation for building more complex and data-rich Ethical Data Validation Showcases in your ThinkAlike applications.

4.2.2 Advanced Schema-Driven Validation - Rigorous Data Integrity and Ethical Compliance
This example showcases the DataTraceability component's power in conjunction with JSON Schema validation. By defining a clear data schema and integrating it with DataTraceability, you can enforce rigorous data integrity and ensure ethical compliance at every step of your workflows!

Code Example (WithSchemaValidation.jsx):

import React from 'react';
import Ajv from 'ajv'; // Import Ajv library for JSON Schema Validation
import DataTraceability from './DataTraceability';

const ajv = new Ajv({allErrors: true}); // Initialize Ajv validator with error reporting enabled

function WithSchemaValidation() {
  // Define example dataFlow prop with more complex data and validation scenarios
  const dataFlow = {
    overallEthicalScore: 62, // Example Ethical Data Score - Lower, indicating potential issues
    overallValidationStatus: 'warning', // Example Validation Status - Warning - indicating potential ethical concerns
    steps: [
      {
        title: "User Profile Data Input",
        description: "User provides detailed profile data, validated against a JSON Schema.",
        dataSource: "UserProfileForm",
        validationStatus: 'warning', // Step Validation Status - Warning - Schema validation raised warnings
        ethicalStepScore: 55, // Example Ethical Step Score - Lower for this step - reflecting data minimization concerns
        ethicalCheckpoints: [
          { guideline: "Data Minimization", status: "warning", details: "User profile data includes optional fields that might be considered non-essential. Consider minimizing data collection to only strictly necessary fields." }, // Ethical Guideline - Warning - potential data minimization issue
          { guideline: "User Consent", status: "valid", details: "Explicit user consent is obtained before profile data submission." } // Ethical Guideline - Valid - user consent is properly handled
        ],
        dataInput: { /* Example User Profile Data - To be added dynamically */ }, // Placeholder for example user profile input data
        dataOutput: { /* Example Validated Data Output - To be added dynamically */ }, // Placeholder for example validated data output
