# ThinkAlike: AI-Driven Workflows

This document describes the AI-driven workflows within the ThinkAlike platform, focusing on how AI is used to enhance user experience, facilitate connections, and ensure ethical data handling.

## 1. Overview

ThinkAlike utilizes AI in several key areas, all designed to be transparent, user-controlled, and ethically sound.  The AI is *not* a black box; its actions and the data it uses are visible to users through the UI (primarily the `DataTraceability` component).

**Core AI Functions:**

*   **Personalized Narrative Journeys (Mode 1):**  Guiding users through self-discovery.
*   **Matchmaking and Connection Recommendations (Mode 2):**  Suggesting potential connections based on shared values, interests, and interaction patterns.
*   **Community Building (Mode 3):** Facilitating the formation and growth of communities.
*   **Data Analysis and Insights:**  Providing users with insights into their own data and the collective data of the platform (with appropriate privacy safeguards).
*   **Ethical Validation:**  Continuously monitoring AI behavior for bias and ensuring compliance with ethical guidelines.

## 2. AI Models and Technologies

*(This section will need to be updated as you choose specific AI models and libraries.  The following is an EXAMPLE.)*

For the MVP, we are initially using the following:

*   **Rule-Based System:**  A simple rule-based system for initial matching and content recommendations. This provides a transparent and easily understandable starting point.
*   **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  We plan to integrate [Specific NLP Library - e.g., SpaCy, NLTK, Transformers] for analyzing user input (text descriptions, values, etc.) and extracting relevant information.
*   **Collaborative Filtering:** We will explore collaborative filtering techniques for recommending connections based on user interactions.

**Future Considerations:**

*   **Deep Learning Models:**  As the project grows, we may explore more advanced deep learning models (e.g., transformer models for NLP, graph neural networks for relationship analysis). *However*, we will only do so if we can maintain transparency and user control.

## 3. Data Workflows

The following data workflows are central to the AI's functionality:

### 3.1. User Profile Creation

1.  **User Input:** User provides data through UI forms (e.g., `UserForm` component). This includes basic information (username, email) and potentially more detailed profile information (values, interests, etc.).
2.  **Frontend Validation:**  The React frontend performs initial data validation (e.g., checking for required fields, email format).
3.  **API Request:** The frontend sends the data to the backend via a `POST /api/v1/users` request (or similar).
4.  **Backend Validation:** The FastAPI backend validates the data using Pydantic models.
5.  **Data Storage:**  The validated data is stored in the database (e.g., in the `Users` and `Profiles` tables).
6.  **AI Processing (Initial):**  At this stage, a simple rule-based system might categorize the user based on their provided information (e.g., assigning initial interest tags).
7.  **UI Feedback:**  The UI confirms successful registration and displays the user's profile.  The `DataTraceability` component shows the data flow.

### 3.2.  Matching (Example)

1.  **Data Retrieval:** The backend retrieves data from the `Users`, `Profiles`, and potentially `Values_Interests` tables.
2.  **AI Processing (Rule-Based):**  A rule-based system calculates a "match score" between users based on shared values/interests (e.g., a simple overlap calculation).
3.  **API Response:** The backend sends a list of potential matches (with associated match scores) to the frontend.
4.  **UI Display:** The frontend displays the potential matches to the user (perhaps using a custom component). The `DataTraceability` component shows which data points contributed to the match score.
5.  **User Action:** The user can choose to connect with a suggested match.
6. **AI Agent Animation:** The AI indicator shows the corresponding animation (blue for processing, transitioning to orange).

### 3.3. Connection Establishment (Example)

1.  **User Action:** User A clicks a "Connect" button on User B's profile.
2.  **API Request:**  The frontend sends a request to the backend (e.g., `POST /api/v1/connections`).
3.  **Backend Logic:** The backend:
    *   Checks if a connection already exists.
    *   Creates a new connection record in the `Connections` table (with a status of "pending").
    *   Notifies User B (potentially via email or a notification system).
4.  **UI Update:** The UI updates to reflect the pending connection request. The AI waveform may change.
5.  **User B Accepts:** User B accepts the connection request.
6.  **API Request:** The frontend sends a request to the backend (e.g., `PUT /api/v1/connections/{connection_id}`).
7.  **Backend Logic:** The backend updates the `status` in the `Connections` table to "accepted".
8.  **UI Update:** The UI updates to show the connection as established. The AI waveform transitions to ruby red, and the triangle indicator appears.

**(Add more data workflows as needed, describing each step in detail.)**

## 4. Ethical Considerations

*   **Data Minimization:**  We collect only the data necessary for the platform's functionality.
*   **Transparency:**  The `DataTraceability` component provides a visual representation of data usage.
*   **User Control:** Users have control over their privacy settings and can modify or delete their data.
*   **Bias Mitigation:**  We are actively working to identify and mitigate biases in our AI models. (Provide specific examples of bias mitigation techniques.)
*   **Explainability:**  We strive to make AI decision-making processes understandable to users. (Describe how this will be achieved â€“ e.g., through visualizations, explanations in tooltips, etc.)

## 5. Testing

*   **(Describe the testing procedures for the AI components.  This should be linked to the `testing_strategy.md` file.)**
*   **(Provide examples of specific test cases related to AI functionality and ethical considerations.)**
* **UI feedback:** All tests are validated by UI data parameters.

This provides a much more detailed and concrete starting point for documenting your AI-driven workflows.  Remember to:

*   **Replace Placeholders:** Fill in the bracketed placeholders with the *actual* technologies and details you're using.
*   **Add More Workflows:**  Document all the key workflows involving AI.
*   **Keep it Updated:** This document should be updated as your project evolves.
