# ThinkAlike Testing Guide

This document outlines the testing procedures and guidelines for the ThinkAlike project. We are committed to building a high-quality, reliable, and ethical platform, and thorough testing is crucial to achieving this.

## Testing Philosophy

*   **Comprehensive Testing:** We aim for comprehensive test coverage, including unit tests, integration tests, UI tests, and user acceptance tests.
*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** We encourage a test-driven development approach, where tests are written *before* the code they are testing. This helps ensure that the code meets the requirements and avoids regressions.
*   **UI as a Testing Framework:** ThinkAlike's unique UI-driven development approach means that the UI itself serves as a *validation tool*. We use UI elements (like the `DataTraceability` component) to visualize data flows, system behavior, and ethical considerations. Tests should *leverage* these UI elements.
*   **Ethical Testing:** Testing should not only verify functionality but also *ethical compliance*. We test for bias in AI models, data privacy violations, and other potential ethical issues.
*   **Data Validation:** All tests should include data validation workflows.

## Testing Levels

We use the following testing levels:

*   **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions, components, or modules in isolation.
    *   **Frontend (React):** Use Jest for unit testing React components.
    *   **Backend (FastAPI):** Use pytest for unit testing Python code.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the interactions between multiple components or modules. This is particularly important for testing the interaction between the frontend and backend.
    *   **Frontend:** Use React Testing Library and potentially Cypress (for end-to-end tests that also involve the backend).
    *   **Backend:** Use pytest and a test client (like FastAPI's built-in `TestClient`) to test API endpoints.
*   **UI Tests:** Test the user interface as a whole, including user interactions and visual appearance.
    *   Use Cypress or Selenium for end-to-end UI testing.
    *   Leverage the `DataTraceability` component to visualize data flows during testing.
    *   Use UI testing parameters to validate data.
*   **User Acceptance Tests (UAT):** Gather feedback from real users to ensure the platform meets their needs and expectations.

## Running Tests

**Frontend (React):**

To run the frontend tests, navigate to the `frontend` directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
npm test
```

**Backend (FastAPI):**

To run the backend tests, navigate to the backend directory in your terminal and run:

```bash
pytest
```

To generate a coverage report:

```bash
pytest --cov=backend --cov-report=term-missing
```

Note: These commands assume you have the necessary testing frameworks installed (Jest for React, pytest for FastAPI). You may need to adjust these commands based on your specific project setup. Make sure that all dependencies are included in the `package.json` file for the frontend, and in the `requirements.txt` file for the backend.

## Writing Tests

**General Guidelines**

*   **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Write tests before writing the code.
*   **Clear and Concise Tests:** Tests should be easy to understand and maintain. Use descriptive names for test functions and test cases.
*   **Small, Focused Tests:** Each test should focus on a single, specific aspect of the functionality.
*   **Isolate Tests:** Tests should be independent of each other. One test should not affect the outcome of another.
*   **Mock Dependencies:** Use mocking frameworks (like jest.mock in React or unittest.mock in Python) to isolate the code you're testing from external dependencies (like API calls or database interactions).
*   **High Test Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage (ideally > 80%), but don't sacrifice test quality for coverage.
*   **UI Parameters:** Use the UI parameters to test and verify the workflows.

**React (Frontend)**

*   **Testing Framework:** Jest (comes with Create React App) and React Testing Library.
*   **File Location:** Place test files alongside the components they are testing (e.g., `DataTraceability.test.jsx` next to `DataTraceability.jsx`).

Example (`DataTraceability.jsx` - Simplified):

```javascript
// frontend/src/components/DataTraceability.test.jsx
import React from 'react';
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import DataTraceability from './DataTraceability';

const testData = {
    nodes: [{ id: 'node1', label: 'Node 1', group: 1 }],
    edges: []
};

test('renders DataTraceability component', () => {
  render(<DataTraceability dataFlow={testData} />);
  const headingElement = screen.getByText(/Data Traceability/i);
  expect(headingElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});

// Add more tests here to:
// - Verify that nodes and edges are rendered correctly.
// - Test the animation logic.
// - Test the tooltip functionality.
// - Test the color transitions based on connectionStatus.
// - Test the UI testing parameter features.
```

**FastAPI (Backend)**

*   **Testing Framework:** pytest
*   **File Location:** Place test files in the `backend/tests` directory.

Example (`main.py` - Simplified):

```python
# backend/tests/test_main.py
from fastapi.testclient import TestClient
from app.main import app  # Import your FastAPI app

client = TestClient(app)

def test_read_root():
    response = client.get("/")
    assert response.status_code == 200
    #assert response.json() == {"Hello": "World"}  # Replace with your actual expected response

# Add more tests here for your API endpoints
```

**AI Model Testing**

(Details on AI model testing will be added here. This will depend heavily on the specific AI models you use.)

Key Considerations:

*   **Bias Detection:** Implement tests to detect and measure biases in your AI models.
*   **Explainability:** Test the explainability features of your AI models.
*   **Robustness:** Test the models' performance on a variety of inputs, including edge cases and adversarial examples.
*   **Ethical Compliance:** Ensure that your AI models adhere to your project's ethical guidelines.

**UI Testing**

*   **Use UI elements to display data and code, to make testing easier.**
*   **Framework:** Cypress, or Selenium.
*   **Implementation:** Every UI component should include features for:
    *   Data input.
    *   Data validation.
    *   Code display.
    *   Performance tracking.
    *   Ethical review.
*   **Go to your `docs` directory:** You should have a file named `testing_guide.md`.
*   **Replace the *entire* content of that file** with the Markdown code provided above.
*   **Commit:** Commit the changes.
