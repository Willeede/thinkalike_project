# ThinkAlike Project Overview

## Introduction

ThinkAlike is an open-source platform designed to foster genuine human connections through ethical technology and user empowerment.  It goes beyond superficial online interactions, aiming to help users:

*   **Discover Themselves:** Explore their values, beliefs, and aspirations.
*   **Connect with Like-Minded Individuals:** Find others who share similar values and goals.
*   **Build Meaningful Relationships:** Transition online interactions into real-world connections.
*   **Contribute to a Better Future:** Participate in a community dedicated to ethical AI and responsible technology.
* **Collaborate:** Build real-world connections.

ThinkAlike leverages AI to *enhance* human connection, *not* to replace it.  The platform prioritizes transparency, user agency, and ethical data handling.  It's built on the principles of "Enlightenment 2.0" â€“ using technology to promote reason, knowledge, and human flourishing.

## Core Values

ThinkAlike is guided by the following core values:

*   **Human-Centered Approach:**  Prioritizing user well-being and agency.
*   **Ethical AI:**  Ensuring AI is used responsibly and transparently.
*   **Transparency & Traceability:**  Open data workflows and auditable code.
*   **User Empowerment:**  Giving users control over their data and experience.
*   **Authenticity:**  Fostering genuine connections.
*   **Community:**  Building a collaborative and supportive community.
*   **Inclusivity:**  Making the platform accessible to everyone.
*   **Privacy & Security:** Protecting user data.
*   **Bias Mitigation:**  Addressing biases in AI models.

## Key Features (MVP and Beyond)

ThinkAlike's functionality is organized around several key areas:

*   **Ethical AI Matching:** An intelligent matchmaking system that connects users based on shared values, interests, and lifestyles, *not* superficial metrics or manipulative algorithms.  The AI's decision-making process is transparent and explainable.
*   **Data Traceability Visualization:**  A unique, interactive "Data Traceability" component that visually shows users *exactly* how their data is being used, where it's coming from, and how it influences AI recommendations. This component is central to the platform's commitment to transparency.
*   **Personalized Narrative Journeys (Mode 1):**  An interactive experience that helps users explore their own values and beliefs through a series of guided questions and prompts. The AI agent assists in this process, providing personalized insights and recommendations.
*   **AI-Powered Video Avatars (Mode 2):**  Users can interact with AI-powered video representations of other users to get a better sense of their personality and interaction style *before* making a direct connection. This helps bridge the gap between online profiles and real-world interactions.
*   **Community Building Tools (Mode 3):** Features to facilitate the formation and growth of communities based on shared interests and goals. This includes tools for group communication, collaboration, and event organization.
*   **UI-Driven Development and Testing:** A unique approach where the UI itself serves as a testing and validation framework for code, data, and AI. This promotes ethical and user-centered development.
*   **Collective Empowerment:** Features to support group collaboration, shared data understanding, and collective decision-making, allowing communities to define their own data usage and privacy preferences.

## Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React (Create React App)
*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
*   **Database:** SQLite (for development), PostgreSQL (planned for production)
*   **AI:** Initially a rule-based system for matching and data traceability visualization. Future plans include exploring more advanced models (e.g., collaborative filtering, natural language processing) for enhanced personalization and community features.
*   **Documentation:** Markdown, rendered with `marked.js` and `mermaid.js` (with plans to migrate to a static site generator like MkDocs).

## Architecture

ThinkAlike follows a modular, three-tier architecture:

1.  **Presentation Layer (UI):** The React-based frontend, responsible for user interaction and data display.
2.  **Application Layer (API, Logic):** The Python/FastAPI backend, handling API requests, business logic, and AI model integration.
3.  **Data Layer (Database, Storage):**  Stores user data, AI model data, and other persistent information.

*(A Mermaid diagram illustrating the architecture is included in the `ONBOARDING_GUIDE.md` file.)*
