# ThinkAlike MVP Implementation Guide

This document provides guidance on implementing the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the ThinkAlike platform. It outlines the core features, the technology stack, and a step-by-step approach to building the MVP.

## 1. Core Features (MVP)

The ThinkAlike MVP will focus on the following core features:

*   **User Registration and Authentication:**
    *   Users can create accounts with a username, email, and password.
    *   Users can log in and log out securely.
    *   Basic password recovery (optional for MVP).
*   **User Profiles:**
    *   Users can create and edit basic profiles (name, bio, location - *very limited* initially).
    *   Users can specify their core values and interests (using a predefined set of options - *keep this simple for the MVP*).
*   **Data Traceability Visualization (Basic):**
    *   The `DataTraceability` component is implemented, displaying a basic node-edge graph.
    *   Initially, the graph visualizes a *simplified, predefined* data flow (e.g., user input -> API request -> database).
    *   The AI agent node is present, with the pulsating light and waveform animations.
    *   Color transitions based on `connectionStatus` are implemented.
    *   The triangle indicator is implemented.
    *   Basic tooltips are implemented.
*   **Matching (Simplified):**
    *   A *very basic* matching algorithm is implemented (e.g., based on a simple overlap of values/interests). This is a *placeholder* for the more sophisticated AI matching to come.
    *   Users can see a list of potential matches.
*   **Connection Requests:**
    *   Users can send connection requests to other users.
    *   Users can accept or reject connection requests.
*   **Direct Messaging (Stretch Goal - If Time Permits):**
    *   *Basic* text-based messaging between connected users. This is a *lower priority* for the MVP.

**We are *explicitly excluding* the following from the MVP:**

*   **Complex AI Models:**  No advanced machine learning or NLP for the MVP. We'll use a simple rule-based system or basic collaborative filtering.
*   **Community Features (Mode 3):**  No group creation, management, or communication features.
*   **Video/Audio Chat:** No real-time communication features.
*   **Comprehensive Profile Customization:**  Only basic profile fields.
*   **Advanced Search/Filtering:**  Only basic search capabilities (if any).

**Focus on the core value proposition: demonstrating data traceability and ethical AI principles through a simplified connection process.**

## 2. Technology Stack

*   **Frontend:** React (Create React App)
*   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
*   **Database:** SQLite (for development), PostgreSQL (planned for production)
*   **AI:** Simple rule-based system (initially)
*   **Documentation:** Markdown, `marked.js`, `mermaid.js` (eventually, a static site generator like MkDocs)
* **Testing:** UI testing components.

## 3. Implementation Steps (Prioritized):**
    * **Step 1: Project Setup and Documentation (Mostly Complete)**
    * **Step 2: Frontend - DataTraceability Component (In Progress)**
        *  Finish basic rendering.
        *  Add the animations
        *  Add tooltips.
        *  Add UI Testing features.
    * **Step 3: Backend API (Basic Endpoints)**
        *  Create FastAPI endpoints for:
             * User registration (`POST /api/v1/users`)
             * User login (likely `POST /api/v1/auth/login`) - Requires implementing JWT authentication.
             * Get user data (`GET /api/v1/users/{user_id}`)
             * Get potential matches (`GET /api/v1/matches`) - Initially based on simple rules.
             * Update connection status (`POST /api/v1/connections`) - Initially a simplified version.
    * **Step 4: Connect Frontend to Backend**
        *  Modify the `DataTraceability` component to fetch data from the API.
        *  Implement UI elements to trigger API calls (e.g., a "Connect" button).
        * Implement basic data display for user profiles.
    * **Step 5: UI Testing Components:**
        * Implement the core UI testing workflows.
    * **Step 6: Deployment**
        *   Deploy all changes to Render.

## 4. UI/UX Guidelines

*   Adhere to the `style_guide.md` for colors, fonts, and overall aesthetic.
*   Prioritize simplicity and clarity in the UI design.
*   Ensure all interactions are accessible.
*   Use the `DataTraceability` component to visualize data flows whenever possible.
*   Emphasize user control and data transparency.

## 5. Code Style and Contribution

*   Follow the guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
*   Use clear and descriptive commit messages (Conventional Commits).
*   Write unit tests for your code.
*   Use UI testing workflows.

This provides a more concrete roadmap and feature set for your MVP. It focuses on building a *functional* core, even if it's simplified, and then iterating from there. Remember to keep the MVP *minimal* â€“ focus on demonstrating the *essential* value proposition of ThinkAlike.

**Actions for Will:**

1.  **Create/Replace Files:** Create or replace the content of the `docs/ai_driven_workflow.md` and `docs/ThinkAlike__MVP_Implementation_Guide.md` files with the content provided above.
2.  **Commit:** Commit your changes.

This gives you two more key documentation files, outlining your AI workflows and your MVP implementation plan. The next step after this will be to return to the `DataTraceability.jsx` component and implement the color transitions.
